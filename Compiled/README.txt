#About:

This is a simple python based program that can download and compile both audio and video from most videos on YouTube

#Common Issues:

If the video is age restricted you might not be able to download any content

If you are using Windows Defender the file will most likely be marked as a virus on launch, this is due to the lack of certification and the fact that windows just sees a generic .exe

If you are attempting to download and compile a video that already exists the application will hang

#PREREQUISITES:

ffmpeg will come packaged within the precompiled folder, however I encourage you to go to their official website and install it yourself, https://www.ffmpeg.org/

#USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Extract all compressed files and drag all ffmpeg executables into the same folder as the YTDlder.exe (or YTDlder.py, depending on what you use)

Simply launch the YTDlder.exe and enter the applicable fields, if you are moving the application to a different location please make sure the ffmpeg applications
are moved along with it
