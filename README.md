# CleverVideoDownloader

#About
  This is a simple python based program that can download and compile both audio and video from most videos on YouTube
  
#Common Issues
  If the video is age restricted you might not be able to download any content
  
  If you are using Windows Defender the file will most likely be marked as a virus on launch, this is due to the lack of certification and the fact that windows just
  sees a generic .exe

  If you don't feel safe installing the exe than you can just install the .py and run it yourself!
  
 #PREREQUISITES
  ffmpeg will come packaged within the precompiled folder, however I encourage you to go to their official website and install it yourself,
